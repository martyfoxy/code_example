A small project with example of my code. Actually it's pretty old and today I'd rewrite some pieces. 

While looking for a job, I got a technical assignment from a company that said:

“Armor works on the logic of percentages: 100 armor lets 0 damage through, 25 armor lets 75% damage through.
Vampirism works the same way. If a player has dealt 50 damage to an enemy, a vampirism of 50 restores 25 life to the player.
The “play with buffs” button restarts the game (restores all player stats to their original values), and randomly adds buffs to players (as described in data.json).
The button “game without buffs”, does the same restart, but without adding buffs.”

I used Zenject as a DI-container
